# git-commands
My collection of useful git commands that I have come across during my time at the Nashville Software School

`git blame` *lists who authored each line of a file, giving the user name with date and time edited. Eg:* `git blame example.txt`

`git stash` *stashes code and* `git stash pop` *gets that code when you need it back. Example usage might be when you have changes that you haven't committed yet in your staging area but you want to clear your staging area of those uncommitted changes.*

`git diff` *gives the name of the file and what changed*

*when using* `git add -p` *the letter* `s` *stands for "split"*

`git commit` *without the* `-m` *will open up the default text editor, such as Vim. If you use Vim to write your commits, you'll have the option to write a short update message on the first line, then add an optiona extended description below. When you write the commit messages in the text editor, use Markdown syntax.*
